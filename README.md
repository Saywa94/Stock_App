# Stock App

## Description

The purpose of this app is to restock easily. You first :
- input items and their ideal amout to have a full stock in the 'Configure' tab.
- input the actual amount of stck ou have in the 'Start' tab.

And then the app calculates the quantity of items to include in your command to re-stock your stock!

This project is a learning tool for me. Please use at you own risk.


## Tecnical details

This is a web app using Python and the Flask framework. It can only run locally but I'll be making online version soon.

It still is in development so don't expect for it to work perfectly, or even at all.
